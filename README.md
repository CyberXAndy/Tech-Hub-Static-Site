# Western Tech Hub - A Version Control Showcase

## Description

This project is a simple front-end website for a fictional tech company, "Western Tech Hub." The primary purpose of this project was to practice and demonstrate proficiency with Git and version control, including branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.

Version Control Tasks:

* **Correcting Typos:** I made several commits to correct typos in the HTML files, demonstrating my ability to make small, incremental changes to a codebase.
* **Branching and Merging:** I created a `Test` branch to work on new features and then merged it back into the `Working` branch.
* **Conflict Resolution:** I successfully resolved a merge conflict that occurred when merging the `Test` and `Working` branches, showcasing my ability to handle common version control issues.
* **Retrospective Documentation:** I created a retrospective directory with a summary of changes and a log of all commits.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Git

## Version Control Highlights

This project demonstrates my understanding of fundamental Git concepts, including:

* **`git clone`**: Cloning a remote repository to my local machine.
* **`git add`**: Staging changes for a commit.
* **`git commit`**: Committing changes to the local repository with clear and concise messages.
* **`git push`**: Pushing changes from the local repository to a remote repository.
* **`git branch`**: Creating new branches to work on features in isolation.
* **`git checkout`**: Switching between branches.
* **`git merge`**: Merging changes from one branch into another.
* **`git tag`**: Tagging a specific point in the repository's history, such as a version release.

## Credits

The initial project template and design were provided as a starting point for this version control exercise. My contributions focused on the version control and Git workflow aspects of the project.
