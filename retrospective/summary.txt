Summary of Changes

1. Merge Conflict Resolution (Part E1):
   The merging conflict that came up in Part E1 was resolved by making changes, to the README.md file to incorporate both the Git version and Student ID sections. I manually combined the conflicting parts to make sure that all information was correctly included.

2. Changes Made in Part C1:
   In Part C1 three modifications were implemented in the HTML files.

   a. index.html (Our Services section):
      Changed:
      <p>We offer some realy great services. </p>
